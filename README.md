This project is a mobile application built with React Native and Expo that allows users to browse, rate, and review GitHub repositories. Users can sign up, sign in, view a list of repositories with details like stars, forks, and ratings, search for specific repositories, sort them by different criteria, and leave reviews with ratings. The app uses Apollo Client to communicate with a GraphQL backend, implements form validation with Formik and Yup, handles authentication with JWT tokens stored in AsyncStorage, and includes testing with Jest.
